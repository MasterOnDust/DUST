## DUST

I'm a big fan of the His Darker Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman 
and I'm currently myself embarking on my own quest to discover the origin of Dust. 
I'm investigating the orrign of wind blown dust, so I won't be crossing between 
parallel universes in my adventure to uncover the source areas of the Chinese Loess deposits.
I'll be using backtrajectory analysis from the FLEXPART particle dispersion model, which is the 
focus of this GitHub repository, still thought that DUST would be a fun and fitting name.
The aim of this package is provide a tools for plotting and analysing FLEXPART and FLEXDUST
model output.
