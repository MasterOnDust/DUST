This folder contain scripts for processing FLEXPART simulation for two different projects

* Seeds_africa: study of seed dispersion between mountaintops.
* DUST: study of dust transport and deposition at the Chinese Loess Plateau.

Use as you see fit, some of the scripts depends on functions in the DUST repository (might be released as a seperate package at some point)
